# Project Context for Claude

## Communication Preferences

Be direct, critical, and objective in feedback. Point out potential issues or better approaches candidly rather than just complying with requests. Provide honest assessment based on technical merit, prioritizing frankness over agreeability while still being helpful and respectful. When something seems wrong, inefficient, or could be better - say so directly. Don't hedge or soften criticism unnecessarily.

When writing documentation or explanations, prefer paragraph format over bulleted lists unless lists are specifically more appropriate for the content.

Proactively update this CLAUDE.md file when conversations reveal key insights that would materially change how to approach the project in future sessions. Focus on context that affects strategy, constraints that limit options, or validated decisions that close off paths. Skip exploratory discussions, implementation details, or observations that don't change the approach.

## Project Overview

Peitho is an LLM-based intent classifier for call centers. Named after the Greek goddess of persuasion and speech, it helps route customer calls by understanding caller intent. A demo is available at peitho.dev.

### Context

The user works at a bank in Hong Kong with direct access to validate use cases. The key differentiator for this project is handling multilingual code-switching between Cantonese, Mandarin, and English, which breaks traditional NLP systems. The strategy is to validate internally with real stakeholders before considering external productization.
